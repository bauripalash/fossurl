#### [üåê Open fossurl website](https://palashbauri.in/fossurl)


### What is Fossurl

Fossurl is an simple URL Shortener Which Can Be Hosted For Free in Github/Gitlab Pages or in Static Site Hosting Service and It doesn't need you to buy any server!


### üéØ Goal
Implementing a Simple URL Shortner which can be used without need of any hardcore server side processing and **can be hosted on Static Site Hostings such as GitHub/Gitlab Pages**

### üíª Stack
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Database : [jsonconnect.com](https://jsonconnect.com/)
(Previously , jsonstore was used but several downtimes forced me to switch to jsonbox.io, then to jsonconnect as jsonbox went offline)

Jsonconnect.com [is a fork of Jsonbox.io](https://github.com/bauripalash/fossurl/issues/29) - learn more on [the project's homepage](https://github.com/jsonconnect/jsonconnect).


### üõ†Ô∏è Features
* It's fast
* It doesn't require any hosting server
* You can use it just by forking the repo and running a script

### Where is my data stored?

The connection between your shorten URL and the long one is stored by jsonconnect.com, and will be available as long as the server is alive. 

The server is set to [keep the data for 99999 days](https://github.com/jsonconnect/jsonconnect/issues/2#issuecomment-825011113), which is somewhere over 200 years üòé!
